# delivery_management
Delivery Management application

## Starting with this template

You would need to clone this repository to copy the files but name the directory with your project name

```bash
git clone <repo-name>
```

This would clone this project and all its code in a directory named `<repo-name>`

Next, lets clean the git files so this new project can have a fresh start

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

Now, we set up git by initializing it and then we link this directory with your git repository

```bash
git init
git remote add origin <repo-name>
```

## Commands
`npm install`: Install all dependencies
`npm run dev`: Start the server in development mode
`npm run format`: Code formatting
